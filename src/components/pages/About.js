            <p>
                My name is Sinthushan and I am a programmer living in the Toronto area. I am interested in fullstack web
                development and am currently enrolled in a part time bootcamp offered at UofT.
            </p>

                Apart from coding I also enjoy travel. I have been to 5 of the 7 continents with Australia and
                Antarctica remaining which I hope to visit soon.
